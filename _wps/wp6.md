number: 6
name: Evaluation of the prototype in the clinical setting
description: Integrate developed solutions into a scalable, generalizable model using heterogeneous datasets, testing ensemble strategies, and evaluating performance in clinical settings. 
---


In this WP we intend to integrate the developed solutions into a scalable and generalizable model, using the several heterogeneous datasets gathered. Different strategies for ensemble  combinations of local models will be tested and compared. Performance will also be analyzed in the clinical setting with the idea of advancing towards a demonstration prototype, using the experience of one of the PIs in dealing with this kind of systems (the Polyman scoring software) used in the daily clinical routine of a sleep specialized hospital, and considered as a reference tool for many clinical researchers worldwide. Usability analysis will be carried out to ensure that we are developing useful and usable AI and it is intended to develop a technology demonstrator which will serve to showcase the technology.
